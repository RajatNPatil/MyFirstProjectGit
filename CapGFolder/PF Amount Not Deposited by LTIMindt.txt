PF Amount Not Deposited by LTIMindtree in my epfo passbook


Dear SSC/LTIMindtree Team,

I am writing to bring to your attention that the Provident Fund (PF) contributions from my LTIMindtree have not yet been deposited/reflected in my EPFO account.
I have already raised 2 tickets in the past and waited for the time they told me too, but still PF is not deposited to my account.

Details:
Name: Rajat Rajendra Nikam
UAN: 101259212425
Previous Employer Name: LTIMindtree

Remarks: After so much time, the PF amount for the complete amount for LTIMindtree PF is still not credited to my EPFO account.

I kindly request you to look into this matter and take necessary action to ensure the full PF amount is deposited at the earliest.

Thank you for your assistance.

Best regards,
Rajat Nikam
